    we see a namespace that declares this HTML to be written using XML syntax. That is also preferred for our courses as a neat and orderly code

        <h1>Hello, welcome to my site!</h1>
        <p>Here is some sample HTML to look at. This is a body paragraph with some <strong>inline</strong> code to feature some text. 
            Here is <a href="https://behrend.psu.edu/penn-state-behrend">a link to an external website</a>.</p>
        <p>In my experiences with using Git hub and word press there are many pros and cons that I have found using both, some things that I feel are helpful with GH are that it makes you 
            learn all the sides of programming compared to word press where it is more like templates that are way easier to make than start from scratch like get hub. word press is way more 
            user friendly from what I have eperienced. For an example in get hub you need to know all the different little codes like a P tag where in word press you can just type and not have 
            to worry about little codes. The good thing about Git Hub is that you have full control and complete customization of the websight rather than picking templates.
            Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the page.
            my experience with coading these websights is that it is turly dificult to figure out what all of it means there is so much going on that it seems crazy!
            However once you get the hang of it I imagine it becomes relativly simple.</p>

        <h2>Starter HTML instructions</h2>
        
        <p>Let's replace the old index.html in your GitHub repo with this new one as you're starting to learn HTML. The hardest part of this may be learning how to browse
        to find where you saved your files in your GitHub repo. You'll get used to this with practice and some organization.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In oXygen, go to File >> Save As, and <b>carefully browse</b> to find your GitHub repo and its <strong>docs/</strong> directory.</li>
            <li>Save this file inside your docs/ directory as <b>index.html</b>. You should save over any index.html you've already saved there to replace with this one.
                (Don't capitalize index.html, spelling counts and you need the .html part at the end.)</li>
            <li>Open your Bash shell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) at your GitHub repo.</li>
            <li>Use your git commands now. Check the <em>status</em> of your repo, <em>add</em> your files for staging, <em>commit</em> them with a message, and <em>push</em> them to the repo.</li>
            <li>Check your GitHub repo on the <q>code view</q> and the web view to see your updates.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>For a more detailed view of HTML, look at <a href="index.html">the actual index.html on this introDH-Hub model website</a>. Feel free to work with that code as you're learning HTML.</p>
        <p>The easiest way we know to create a new page for your site is to save the current one you're working on with a new filename in the same directory. 
            Open the new file so you can keep working. You'll need to create <a href="innerPage.html">a special kind of relative link to connect the pages</a>, like this.</p>
    </body>
